* Setup
** Docker
#+begin_src bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 --rm $(docker build -q .)
#+end_src

* Auth Service
- =JWT= for stateless authentication.
- Refresh token in http only cookie for session persistence
- Deno for testing purposes, also, having TypeScript by default is pretty neat
- Using in memory Object as DB for the reduced complexity

* Client
- =React= spa
- use local storage with username as a proxy for the refresh token to avoid network calls

* What's Next
- work on edge cases
- Use an actual data base
- remove refresh tokens from device list when exp
- add route to remove refresh tokens manually (i.e logoff remotely)
- add more precise type interfaces
- return proper http error codes
- use SSR?
- isolate authentication in it's own service
